## Before You Begin

Determine whether you will use Hazelcast installed locally on your computer or Hazelcast Cloud. 

For local installation, go to the [Hazelcast Platform Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.0/). Follow the instructions to install Hazelcast and connect a Java client. (Java is required for this course.) 

For Hazelcast Cloud, go to the [Hazelcast Cloud Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/cloud/getting-started) and follow the instructions to set up a free instance of Hazelcast, then connect a Java client.
